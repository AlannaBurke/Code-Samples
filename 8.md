Here's one I just worked on, related to [7.md](7.md). The client wanted to change
up their search results. Previously, the search results for documents returned a
link to the node for the document as well as the ugly looking filename. They
wanted to return the pretty title but have it open the document directly, not go
to the node.

We were using Search API's default search template, so here's what I did:

- Implement a "search result" view mode.
- Create templates for that view mode and set up each content type.
- For the document content type, I preprocessed the files like so to change the
ugly file name to the name given in the node:

```
/**
 * Implements template_preprocess_node().
 */
function client_search_preprocess_node(&$variables) {
  // Change the file name to the name given in the node.
  // When the file is rendered, it will have this user-friendly title.
  if ($variables['content']['field_file']['#bundle'] == 'plan_documents') {
    $file = $variables['content']['field_file'];
    $file_name = $variables['title'];
    $file[0]['#file']->filename = $file_name;
  }
}
```

And then we could have a nice, clean template just returning the rendered file:
```
<li class="search-result">
  <h3 class="title">
     <?php if ($content['field_file']): ?>
        <?php print render($content['field_file']); ?>
      <?php endif; ?>
  </h3>
</li>
```


They also wanted to change the pdf icon across the site, but no other. I was
able to accomplish this with `hook_file_icon`:

```
function client_theme_file_icon($variables) {
  $file = $variables['file'];
  $icon_directory = $variables['icon_directory'];

  $mime = check_plain($file->filemime);

  if ($mime == 'application/pdf') {
    $icon_directory = drupal_get_path('theme', 'nmd_aurora') . '/images';
  }

  $icon_url = file_icon_url($file, $icon_directory);
  return '<img class="file-icon" alt="" title="' . $mime . '" src="' . $icon_url . '" />';
}
```
